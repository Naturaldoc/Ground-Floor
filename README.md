# Ground Floor
## Basic HTML Styling for NeoCities.org websites

### What is Ground Floor?

Beyond normalizing, but not super-stylized-HTML either:

Ground Floor is the prettying up of HTML tags so that even if you never add a single class, or touch a line of CSS your HTML won't look like a jumble of browser presets or bland looking text.


### HTML Styling

From headings to tables, forms to HTML5 elements, Ground Floor standardizes and lightly extends basic styling for many HTML elements.

    * Form Elements
    * Media Elements
    * Nav Elements
    * Table Elements
    * Text Elements

### Basic Classes

While the point of this framework is to give basic styling to HTML without the need for CSS knowledge, for those that do have a basic knowledge of CSS, and want to add just a bit extra to their websites, here are a few basic classes with examples.

    * CSS Buttons
    * CSS Layout
    * CSS Helper Classes
